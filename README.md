This application fetches the most popular and latest news headlines from over 70 of the highest-rated news sites in the world. It provides you with a simple interface to view all the headlines and be redirected to the full article in one click. News sources are arranged in categories and you can search for your favourites in the search box.

This project is built with React using the Flux Architecture. Code is written in ES2015, Babel is used to transpile down to ES5, SCSS is used to implement all custom styling, and Webpack is used to bundle all modules in the project and convert SCSS to CSS. Data is received from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org) through API requests. Authentication is made via Firebase Google Authentication. [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) styleguide is used and configured in my .eslintrc to expose and flag incorrect ES6 syntax. HoundCI checks forstyle violations in PRs and TravisCI ensure that all test pass. The app is tested using Mocha test runner with Chai, Enzyme and Chai-Enzyme.
